    qsTr("Alter Linux is a new OS developed based on Arch Linux.\nCombining a sophisticated UI and a package management tool complete with a GUI, anyone can easily use the latest OS at high speed.\nInstallation takes a little time. In the meantime, slides introduce the features of Alter Linux."),
    qsTr("Alter Linux shares the main repository with Arch Linux.\nHowever, there is only a minimal Arch Linux repository. Alter Linux makes it easy to install pre-built kernels and useful software with its own repository.\nAll management, such as software installation and update, can be easily performed on the GUI.\nYou do not need to check for updates manually. You will be notified in a notification if there is an update."),
    qsTr("Alter Linux is easy for anyone to use.\nIf you are migrating from Ubuntu, you do not need to learn the syntax of pacman, new package management system. Alter Linux can use apt's syntax as it is.\nIf you have used Arch Linux already, there is nothing wrong with it. Existing ArchWiki information can be used as is, and AUR can be used as is.\nYou can start using the best system immediately without the hassle of installing from the CLI."),
    qsTr("Alter Linux has a beautiful UI.\nIt offers an unprecedented desktop experience with its unique sophisticated login screen and UI.\nXfce4, the default desktop environment, has a flexible structure and can be freely customized to make it easy for users to use."),
    qsTr("We thank you very much for installing Alter Linux and hope to have a comfortable PC life.\nIf you have any wishes or questions about Alter Linux, please visit the official website or GitHub.")
